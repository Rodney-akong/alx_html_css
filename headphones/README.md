This project is a fully hand-crafted static web page built entirely from scratch using pure HTML and CSS, with careful attention to accessibility, responsiveness, and pixel-accurate design matching.

There are no external CSS frameworks, no JavaScript libraries, and no UI kits — the goal is to demonstrate strong fundamentals in frontend development.
